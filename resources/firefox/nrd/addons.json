Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified.\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/\nHow It Works:

All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy. We do not—and will never—collect any of your usage data.\n\nWhat do I do if I have trouble?\nVisit our GitLab page or check out our wiki.\n\nWrite us...\nIf have any suggestions or complaints, please contact us on GitLab.\n\nPermissions\nReasoning for needed permissions can be found under here.\n\nContributors\n\n    Kevin Röbert (creator/developer)\n    Yi-Ping Huang (translator)\n    rayman89 (translator)\n    Ramon Santilli (translator)\n    Lucifer (translator)\n    Shitennouji (translator)\n    perdolka (contributor)\n    Nameless (contributor)\n    a-polivanchuk (translator)\n    hydrargyrum (translator)\n    alekksander (translator)\n    Zoltan Toldy (translator)\n    tartpvule (contributor)\n    Giovanni (translator)\n    U.

the ability to disable JavaScript for specific sites or specific tabs.\nYou can customize the default JS state (on or off), the disable behavior (by domain or by tab) and much more.","fullDescription":"Introduction\nThis web extension lets an user decide if JavaScript should be enabled or disabled for a given host or a given tab.\n\nFeatures\n\n    Set the default state (JS on or JS off)\n    Set the disable behavior (By domain or by tab)\n    Use shortcuts (you can also disable this)\n    Use a context menu item for toggling (you can also disable this)\n    See your blacklisted/whitelisted domain list\n    Add domains manually before visiting a site\n    Add base domains that automatically enable/disable JS for sub domains\n\n\nUsage\nWhen accessing e.g. mozilla.org and disabling JavaScript, the web extension will block all JavaScript which otherwise would be loaded by mozilla.org (including inline JS and external JS files from other hosts).\n\nPlease note that scripts from the blacklisted host will still be loaded if they're being loaded in another host (unless you block that host as well of course).\n\nSupported browsers\n\n    Mozilla Firefox (Desktop & Firefox for Android)\n    Google Chrome (Desktop)\n\n\nWhy to use this web extension\nThe code is completely open source, you can also use the unpacked version of this web extension if you prefer.\nNo data of you will ever be logged and the web extension asks only for the permissions it really needs.\nPull requests are welcome!\n\nFuture plans\nYou can see existing and add new feature proposals on the projects GitHub page.\n\nOther web extensions\n\n    View Page Source (Mobile)\n\n\nSupport\nIf you need any assistance or find any bugs, feel free to contact me directly via email or

tool to install, manage and use Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in Mozilla Firefox","fullDescription":"Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use web APIs and features along with progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. Although Firefox supports many of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to install them as a standalone system app with an app-like experience. This functionality is often also known as a Site Specific Browser (SSB).\n\nThis project creates a custom modified Firefox runtime to allow websites to be installed as standalone apps and provides a console tool and browser extension to install, manage and use them.\n\nImportant: To fix a critical security vulnerability, make sure to update (at least the native program) to v2.12.0 as soon as possible.\n\nYou can check out the installation and usage instructions on our documentation website. You can also check out the project's source code and more information on the GitHub repository.\n\nNote: I will appreciate it if you read and participate in a GitHub discussion to suggest how to make this project more user-friendly and which features would you like the most. You can also read and participate in a GitHub discussion about the documentation website.","weeklyDownloads":685,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Filip Š","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13099137/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258556.png?modified=1689538600","width":678,"height":918,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258556.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":295,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Installing sites as a PWAs with just a few clicks"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258557.png?modified=1689538600","width":661,"height":864,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258557.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":306,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Managing and launching installed sites from your browser"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258572.png?modified=1689538600","width":652,"height":862,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258572.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":303,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Organizing sites into different profiles for multiple instances of the same site"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258573.png?modified=1689538600","width":1204,"height":971,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258573.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":496,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Launching installed sites directly from your operating system"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258558.png?modified=1689538600","width":2290,"height":1756,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258558.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":522,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Opened sites will have their own window with separate taskbar icon and group for a better app-like experience"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/259/259934.png?modified=1689538600","width":2400,"height":1244,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/259/259934.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":276,"caption":"The project supports most major operating systems and desktop environments"}],"contributionURL":"https://github.com/sponsors/filips123?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.6062,"reviewCount":99,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/reviews/","updateDate":1714579515000},{"id":"giantpinkrobots@protonmail.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2833/2833017-32.png?modified=e2ea70ff","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2833/2833017-64.png?modified=e2ea70ff","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2833/2833017-128.png?modified=e2ea70ff"},"name":"Varia Integrator","version":"1.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4282799/varia_integrator-1.1.xpi","homepageURL":"https://giantpinkrobots.github.io/varia/","supportURL":"https://github.com/giantpinkrobots/varia","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/varia-integrator/","description":"Route all downloads to Varia if it's running.","fullDescription":"Integrate with the Varia download manager.","weeklyDownloads":66,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Giant Pink Robots!","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17916401/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/295/295730.png?modified=1708075865","width":640,"height":400,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/295/295730.jpg?modified=1708075865","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":2,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/varia-integrator/reviews/","updateDate":1714985716000}]}
